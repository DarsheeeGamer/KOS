# KOS Kernel Integration

This directory contains the complete KOS kernel implementation with all major subsystems integrated into a cohesive whole.

## Architecture Overview

The KOS kernel consists of the following major components:

### Core Kernel (`kcore.c/h`)
- Process and thread management
- Basic scheduler interface
- Memory allocation wrappers
- Core data structures

### System Call Interface (`syscall.c`)
- Complete system call table following Linux conventions
- Parameter validation and error handling
- System call statistics and debugging
- Support for 100+ system calls

### Kernel Initialization (`init.c`)
- Boot sequence management
- Subsystem initialization in proper order
- Emergency mode handling
- Graceful shutdown procedures

### Panic and Debugging (`panic.c`)
- Kernel panic handling with stack traces
- Core dump generation
- Debug output with multiple levels
- Emergency sync and recovery

### Time Management (`time.c`)
- High-resolution timers
- Multiple clock sources
- Timer wheels for efficient timer management
- Nanosecond precision timing

### Interrupt Management (`irq.c`)
- IRQ registration and handling
- Threaded interrupt support
- IRQ load balancing
- Nested interrupt handling

## Subsystem Integration

The kernel integrates with the following subsystems:

- **Scheduler** (`sched/`): CFS, RT, and deadline scheduling
- **Memory Management** (`mm/`): Buddy allocator, slab cache, page tables
- **IPC** (`ipc/`): Message queues, semaphores, shared memory, pipes
- **Filesystem** (`fs/`): VFS, inode cache, file operations
- **Drivers** (`drivers/`): Character, block, network, and TTY drivers
- **Network** (`net/`): Network stack implementation

## Building

```bash
# Build everything
make all

# Build individual components
make sched
make mm
make ipc
make fs
make drivers

# Run tests
make test_kernel

# Clean build files
make clean
```

## Key Features

### System Call Interface

- Error handling and debugging support

### Time Management
- Multiple timer types: one-shot, periodic, high-resolution
- Timer wheels for O(1) timer management
- Multiple clock sources with automatic selection
- Nanosecond precision timing

### Interrupt Handling
- Support for shared and exclusive IRQs
- Threaded interrupt handling
- IRQ load balancing across CPUs
- Nested interrupt support

### Panic Handling
- Comprehensive crash dumps with stack traces
- Emergency filesystem sync
- Multiple panic recovery modes
- Debug output with configurable levels

### Boot Process
- Ordered subsystem initialization
- Boot parameter parsing
- Emergency mode support
- Graceful shutdown procedures

## Integration Points

### Process Management
- Unified process/thread creation
- Namespace and cgroup integration
- Signal handling
- Exit and cleanup procedures

### Memory Management
- Integration with scheduler for memory pressure
- Page fault handling
- Memory mapping support
- NUMA awareness (future)

### I/O Subsystem
- Unified I/O interface
- Async I/O support
- Buffer management
- Device driver integration

## Testing

The kernel includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run integration tests
./test_kernel

# Test individual subsystems
make -C sched test
make -C mm test
make -C ipc test
```

## Configuration

The kernel can be configured through:

- Boot parameters
- Runtime sysfs interface
- Proc filesystem
- Debug interfaces

## Debugging

Debug features include:

- Kernel panic with stack traces
- System call tracing
- IRQ statistics
- Timer profiling
- Memory leak detection

## Performance

The kernel is designed for performance:

- O(1) scheduler for most operations
- Efficient timer management
- Lock-free algorithms where possible
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- IRQ load balancing

## Security

Security features include:

- System call parameter validation
- Capability-based access control
- Namespace isolation
- Stack protection
- Control flow integrity

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

- SMP support with per-CPU data structures
- Real-time scheduling improvements
- Advanced memory management features
- Network stack optimizations
- Security hardening
