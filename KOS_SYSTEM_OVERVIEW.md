## Introduction

The Kaede Operating System (KOS) is a Python-based virtual operating system environment that provides filesystem management, package management, user authentication, and a command-line interface. It's designed to be modular, extensible, and cross-platform.

## System Architecture

KOS follows a modular architecture with the following key subsystems:

1. **Core System** - The central initialization and coordination layer
2. **Filesystem** - Virtual filesystem with UNIX-like structure
3. **Package Management** - Application installation and dependency handling
4. **User System** - Authentication and user management
5. **Shell** - Command-line interface for user interaction

The system initializes components in a specific order to maintain dependencies between subsystems:

```
Filesystem → Authentication Manager → User System → Package Manager → Shell
```

## Core Components

### Filesystem

The filesystem module provides a virtual file system with directories and files. It includes:

- File and directory management
- Path resolution
- Permission handling
- Basic file operations

### Package Manager

The package management system (KPM) handles:

- Repository management
- Package installation and removal
- Dependency resolution
- Version management

### User System

The user system handles:

- User accounts and authentication
- Permission management
- Session handling

### Shell

The shell component provides:

- Command-line interface
- Command parsing and execution
- Application launching
- Help and documentation access

## Directory Structure

KOS has the following directory structure:

```
kos/
├── __init__.py         # Main package initialization
├── auth_manager.py     # Authentication management
├── base.py             # Core system components
├── commands.py         # Shell commands implementation
├── disk/               # Disk management subsystem
├── exceptions.py       # System-wide exceptions
├── filesystem/         # Virtual filesystem implementation

└── qotd/               # Quote of the Day application

repo/                   # Package repository
├── files/              # Package files
└── index.json          # Repository index
```

## Extending KOS

KOS can be extended in multiple ways:

### 1. Developing Applications

Create applications that run within the KOS environment. These are installed via the package manager and can integrate with the shell. See the [KOS Application Development Guide](KOS_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md) for details.

### 2. Creating Package Repositories

Build and maintain repositories of KOS applications for distribution. See the [KOS Repository Creation Guide](KOS_REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md) for details.

### 3. Extending Core Components

The KOS architecture allows for extending or replacing core components:

- Add new shell commands by extending the command system
- Implement alternative filesystem backends
- Create custom authentication providers
- Extend the package manager for additional repository types

To extend core components, you typically:

1. Create a subclass of the relevant base class
2. Override or extend the necessary methods
3. Register your extension with the appropriate manager

Example of extending the shell with a new command:

```python
from kos.commands import register_command

@register_command
def my_command(shell, args):
    """My custom command
    
    Usage: my_command [arguments]
    """
    # Command implementation
    return True
```
