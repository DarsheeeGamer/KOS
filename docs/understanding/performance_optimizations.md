# KOS Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document details the performance optimizations implemented in KOS to ensure efficient operation and scalability.

## Key Performance Features

### 1. Object Pooling
- **Purpose**: Reduce allocation/deallocation overhead
- **Implementation**: Generic `ObjectPool` class for recycling objects
- **Usage**: Process objects, VFS nodes, buffers
- **Benefits**: Reduced GC pressure, faster object creation

### 2. Memory Management

#### Memory Pooling
- Pre-allocated memory blocks for efficient allocation
- Configurable block sizes (default: 4KB)
- Automatic pool expansion when needed
- Bypass for large allocations

#### Page-Aligned Buffers
- Direct I/O support with aligned buffers
- Reduced kernel copying overhead
- Efficient for high-performance I/O operations

### 3. Caching Systems

#### LRU Cache
- Thread-safe implementation with TTL support
- Used for:
  - Path resolution caching in VFS
  - Stat results caching
  - Process information caching
- Configurable size and expiration

#### Memoization Decorator
- Function result caching
- Automatic cache key generation
- TTL and size limits
- Cache statistics tracking

### 4. Lock-Free Data Structures

#### Lock-Free Queue
- Atomic operations for thread safety
- No mutex overhead
- Used for high-throughput message passing
- Bounded size to prevent memory issues

### 5. CPU Optimization

#### CPU Affinity Management
- NUMA node detection and binding
- Thread-to-CPU pinning
- Load balancing across cores
- Process affinity control

#### Batch Processing
- Signal batching for reduced context switches
- Configurable batch size and wait time
- Automatic flush on timeout
- Used for signal delivery optimization

### 6. I/O Optimization

#### Direct I/O
- O_DIRECT flag support
- Bypass kernel buffer cache
- Reduced memory copying

#### Read-Ahead/Behind Hints
- posix_fadvise integration
- Sequential/random access hints
- Improved kernel prefetching

### 7. JIT Compilation

#### Dynamic Code Generation
- Runtime code optimization
- Loop unrolling
- Hot path optimization
- Python exec-based implementation

### 8. Performance Monitoring

#### Real-Time Metrics
- CPU usage tracking (overall and per-core)
- Memory usage monitoring
- I/O statistics
- Garbage collection metrics

#### Performance Analysis
- Historical data with circular buffers
- Summary statistics
- Trend analysis
- Resource usage patterns

## Usage Examples

### Object Pool Usage
```python
# Create object pool
process_pool = ObjectPool(
    factory=lambda: KOSProcess(0, 0, "/bin/init", ProcessType.NORMAL),
    max_size=100
)

# Acquire and release objects
process = process_pool.acquire()
# Use process...
process_pool.release(process)
```

### Caching Example
```python
# Function memoization
@memoize(max_size=128, ttl=60.0)
def expensive_calculation(x, y):
    # Complex computation
    return result

# Path caching in VFS
cached_node = self._path_cache.get(path)
if cached_node is None:
    node = self._resolve_path_slow(path)
    self._path_cache.put(path, node)
```

### CPU Affinity
```python
# Bind to NUMA node
cpu_affinity = get_cpu_affinity()
cpu_affinity.bind_to_numa_node(0)

# Set specific CPU affinity
cpu_affinity.set_thread_affinity([0, 1, 2, 3])
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Create batch processor
signal_batcher = BatchProcessor(
    process_func=self._process_signal_batch,
    batch_size=50,
    max_wait=0.01  # 10ms
)

# Add items for batching
signal_batcher.add((pid, signal))
```

## Performance Guidelines

### When to Use Object Pools
- Frequently created/destroyed objects
- Objects with expensive initialization
- High-throughput scenarios
- Limited memory environments

### Cache Sizing
- Path cache: 1000 entries (60s TTL)
- Stat cache: 500 entries (30s TTL)
- Process cache: 100 entries (1s TTL)
- Adjust based on workload

### CPU Affinity Best Practices
- Pin I/O threads to specific cores
- Isolate critical processes
- Consider NUMA topology
- Leave some cores for system tasks

### I/O Optimization Tips
- Use direct I/O for large sequential reads
- Enable read-ahead for sequential access
- Disable read-ahead for random access
- Use aligned buffers for best performance

## Performance Metrics

### Monitoring Commands
```python
# Get performance summary
monitor = get_performance_monitor()
summary = monitor.get_summary()

# Get detailed metrics
metrics = monitor.get_metrics()

# Object pool statistics
stats = process_pool.get_stats()

# Cache hit rates
cache_stats = path_cache.get_stats()
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
- CPU usage: Should stay below 80% for responsive system
- Memory usage: Monitor for leaks and excessive allocation
- Cache hit rate: Aim for >90% for hot paths
- GC frequency: Minimize with object pooling
- I/O wait: Optimize with proper buffering

## Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements
1. **SIMD Operations**: Vectorized operations for bulk data processing
2. **Zero-Copy I/O**: sendfile/splice support
3. **Memory-Mapped Files**: Efficient large file handling
4. **Thread Pool Executors**: Pre-warmed worker threads
5. **Compressed Memory**: Transparent memory compression
6. **Adaptive Algorithms**: Self-tuning based on workload

### Research Areas
- Hardware acceleration (GPU compute)
- Persistent memory support
- Network stack optimization
- Advanced scheduling algorithms
- Machine learning for prediction

## Debugging Performance

### Performance Profiling
```python
# Enable detailed profiling
import cProfile
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()
# ... code to profile ...
profiler.disable()
profiler.print_stats()
```

### Memory Profiling
```python
# Track memory usage
import tracemalloc
tracemalloc.start()
# ... code to analyze ...
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
```

### Bottleneck Identification
1. Check cache hit rates
2. Monitor lock contention
3. Analyze GC frequency
4. Profile hot paths
5. Review I/O patterns

## Conclusion

KOS implements comprehensive performance optimizations across all subsystems. These optimizations ensure efficient resource utilization, low latency, and high throughput. Continuous monitoring and profiling help maintain optimal performance as the system evolves.
