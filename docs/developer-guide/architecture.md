# KOS Architecture

This document provides an overview of the KOS architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## System Overview

KOS is designed as a modular, extensible operating system shell built in Python. It provides a Unix-like environment with a focus on simplicity and extensibility.

## Core Components

### 1. Shell System

- **Shell (kos/shell/shell.py)**: The main interactive shell interface
- **Command Parser**: Handles command input and parsing
- **Command Dispatcher**: Routes commands to appropriate handlers
- **History Manager**: Manages command history

### 2. File System Abstraction

- **FileSystem (kos/filesystem/)**: Abstract base class for file system operations
- **InMemoryFileSystem**: In-memory implementation for testing
- **LocalFileSystem**: Local file system implementation
- **File Node**: Represents files and directories

### 3. Process Management

- **ProcessManager (kos/process/manager.py)**: Manages running processes
- **Process**: Represents a running process
- **Job Control**: Handles foreground/background jobs

### 4. Package Management

- **PackageManager (kos/package/manager.py)**: Manages software packages
- **Repository**: Handles package repositories
- **Dependency Resolver**: Resolves package dependencies

## Data Flow

1. **Command Input**: User enters a command in the shell
2. **Parsing**: Command is parsed into tokens
3. **Dispatching**: Command is routed to the appropriate handler
4. **Execution**: The command is executed
5. **Output**: Results are displayed to the user

## Concurrency Model

KOS uses Python's threading and asyncio for concurrency:

- **I/O-bound operations**: Run in separate threads
- **CPU-bound operations**: Run in process pools
- **Event Loop**: Manages async operations

## Security Model

- **User Permissions**: Basic user/group permissions
- **Process Isolation**: Limited process isolation
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure by default configuration

## Extension Points

### 1. Commands

New commands can be added by creating a class that inherits from `Command` and implementing the `execute` method.

### 2. File Systems

New file system implementations can be added by extending the `FileSystem` class.

### 3. Package Managers

New package managers can be added by implementing the `PackageManager` interface.

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on demand
- **Memory Management**: Resources are released when no longer needed
- **Optimized Path Handling**: Efficient path manipulation

## Error Handling

- **Exceptions**: Custom exceptions for different error types
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable performance

## Future Directions

- **Plug-in System**: For extending functionality
- **Improved Concurrency**: Better support for async/await
- **More File Systems**: Support for additional storage backends
- **Enhanced Security**: Additional security features
